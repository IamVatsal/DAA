# Design and Analysis of Algorithms - Practicals

This repository contains practical implementations for my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course in Semester 4. It serves as a learning resource and documentation of various algorithm implementations covered during the course.

## 📚 About

This repository is created for educational purposes to:
- Store and organize all practical code from the DAA course
- Practice implementing various algorithms and data structures
- Understand time and space complexity analysis
- Build a reference for algorithm implementations

Each practical folder contains:
- Source code files (C/C++/Python/Java)
- Implementation of specific algorithms
- Comments explaining the logic

## 📋 List of Practicals

### Practical 1: Basic Algorithms
- **factorial.c**: Factorial calculation implementation
- **oneToN.c**: Print numbers from 1 to N

### Practical 2: (Coming Soon)
- _To be updated as course progresses_

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler (for C programs)
- Basic knowledge of command line

### Compiling and Running C Programs

```bash
# Navigate to the practical folder
cd Prac1/

# Compile a C program
gcc factorial.c -o factorial

# Run the compiled program
./factorial
```

### General Compilation Command
```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
```
